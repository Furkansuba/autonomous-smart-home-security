# Demo Runbook — Autonomous Smart Home Security

---

## 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20
- npm
- Android Studio (with an emulator or physical device, API 26+)
- MongoDB Atlas cluster (active, with your current IP whitelisted)
- Both `backend/` and `admin-web/` dependencies installed

---

## 2. Environment Setup

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `backend/.env` and fill in the two required values:

```
MONGODB_URI=<your Atlas connection string>
JWT_SECRET=<any long random string for demo>
```

All other values can stay at the `.env.example` defaults.

```bash
npm install
```

---

## 3. Seed Demo Data

Run all three from the `backend/` directory:

```bash
npm run seed:demo-admin      # creates admin@smarthome.local / Admin123!
npm run seed:demo-resident   # creates resident@smarthome.local / Resident123!
npm run seed:demo            # seeds devices, events, telemetry, access logs, overrides
```

`seed:demo` is safe to re-run — it cleans existing demo records before inserting.

---

## 4. Start Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

Verify the backend is up:

```
GET http://localhost:5000/health
```

Expected: `database.connected: true` in the response. If `false`, check your `MONGODB_URI` and Atlas IP whitelist before continuing.

---

## 5. Start Admin Web

```bash
cd admin-web
npm install
npm run dev
```

Admin web runs at `http://localhost:5173`.

---

## 6. Run Android App

Open the `android/` directory in Android Studio and run on an emulator or physical device.

**Physical phone:** No code change needed. `BASE_URL` is set to `https://smarthome-capstone.duckdns.org/` (committed in `5b1cdbf`). The app connects to the public EC2 backend over HTTPS. Physical phone test result: admin login, all screens (Dashboard, Devices, Alerts, Sensors, Overrides), safe override execution (`buzzer_off` → `executed`), and resident RBAC (Admin Actions card absent) — all verified.

**Emulator:** The emulator cannot reach the HTTPS public domain by default. For local emulator testing, temporarily change `BASE_URL` in `android/app/build.gradle.kts:18` to `http://10.0.2.2:5000/` and run a local backend. Revert to the HTTPS URL before physical device testing.

---

## 7. Demo Credentials

| Role     | Email                        | Password       |
|----------|------------------------------|----------------|
| Admin    | `admin@smarthome.local`      | `Admin123!`    |
| Resident | `resident@smarthome.local`   | `Resident123!` |

> Both accounts have password recovery configured. Recovery answers are not stored in this document.

---

## 8. Android Demo Flow

### 8.1 Biometric Unlock — Stored-Session Flow

The Android biometric feature is a **stored-session unlock**, not a standalone biometric authentication. It only appears when a valid JWT from a previous password login is already stored on the device. It is a convenience feature — the underlying authentication is always the password + server-issued token.

**To demonstrate biometric unlock:**

1. Log in with `admin@smarthome.local` / `Admin123!` using the password form.
2. Force-close the app (swipe it away from the recents menu).
3. Relaunch the app — the biometric prompt appears automatically.
4. Authenticate with the enrolled fingerprint — the app navigates directly to Dashboard without re-entering a password.
5. Tap **Use password** at any time to fall back to the credential form.

**Note:** The biometric prompt does not appear on a fresh install or after logout, because there is no stored session token. Enroll a fingerprint at **Android Settings → Security → Fingerprint** if the prompt does not appear.

---

### 8.2 Android Demo Flow — Admin Account

**Login:**
1. Launch the app — the Login screen appears.
2. Enter `admin@smarthome.local` / `Admin123!` and tap **Login**.

**Dashboard (Home tab):**
3. After login, the Dashboard shows device summary cards and recent critical events.
4. Tap a device card to jump to the Devices tab; tap an event card to jump to the Alerts tab.

**Devices tab:**
5. Lists all three seeded devices with **online / degraded / offline** status badges.

**Alerts tab:**
6. Shows fire, gas, intrusion, and motion events with severity color coding (critical / warning / info).
7. Point out the `fire_detected` (kitchen) and `gas_detected` (garage) events — both show as critical.

**Sensors tab:**
8. Shows the latest telemetry reading per room — temperature, humidity, gas raw, CO raw, motion, flame, reed state.

**Override History:**
9. From the Dashboard, open the Overrides screen via the pending overrides card.
10. Four seeded overrides are shown:
    - `requested` — buzzer_off pending
    - `executed` — door_unlock completed
    - `failed` — valve_open on degraded device
    - `blocked` — pump_on blocked by gas/CO lockout rule

**Safe Override Actions (admin-only):**
11. At the top of the Overrides screen, the **Admin Actions** card is visible with four buttons in a 2×2 grid.
12. Row 1 (red): **Silence Alarm** (`buzzer_off`) and **Test Buzzer** (`buzzer_on`).
13. Row 2 (secondary): **Stop Pump** (`pump_off`) and **Close Valve** (`valve_close`).
14. Tap any action → confirm in the dialog — the command is sent to `esp32_home_01`.
15. With `OVERRIDE_DEMO_AUTO_ACK=true` on EC2, safe actions auto-complete to `executed` within ~500 ms without requiring a real ESP32 response.
16. The new override record appears in the history list with `status: executed`.
17. **Note:** auto-ack is a demo-only convenience. Active hazard events (fire/gas/CO) are **not** cleared by alarm silence — they remain visible in the Events collection.

---

### 8.3 Android Demo Flow — Resident Account

15. Tap the Profile tab → **Logout**.
16. Log in as `resident@smarthome.local` / `Resident123!`.
17. Navigate through Dashboard, Devices, Alerts, and Sensors — all are accessible in read-only mode.
18. Open the Overrides screen — the four override history records are visible.
19. The **Admin Actions card is not rendered** — the admin-only section is completely absent from the UI.

---

### 8.4 Android Demo Flow — Registration and Recovery

**Registration with security question:**

1. From the Login screen tap **Create account** — the Register screen opens.
2. Fill in Full Name, Email, Password, and Confirm Password.
3. Tap the **Security Question** dropdown — six fixed options appear via `ExposedDropdownMenuBox`. Select one.
4. Enter a **Security Answer** in the field below.
5. Leave Admin Key blank for a resident account, or enter the admin key to register as admin.
6. The **Create Account** button stays disabled until all required fields (including security question and answer) are non-blank.
7. Tap **Create Account** — the account is created and the app navigates directly to the Dashboard.
8. The selected question is stored on the server. The security answer is never stored in plaintext; it is transmitted over HTTPS during registration and recovery reset, and verified against a bcrypt hash on the server.

**Forgot password (account recovery):**

1. From the Login screen tap **Forgot password?** below the Create account button.
2. The **Account Recovery** screen opens.
3. **Step 1 — Email:** Enter the registered email address and tap **Find My Security Question**.
4. The backend returns the registered question (HTTP 200 regardless of whether the email exists — no account enumeration).
5. **Step 2 — Answer:** The security question is displayed in a read-only card. Enter the security answer, a new password (≥ 8 characters, one uppercase letter, one digit), and confirm it.
6. Tap **Reset Password** — on success the screen shows "Password updated. Please sign in."
7. The app does NOT log in automatically. Tap **← Back to Sign In** and sign in with the new password.
8. The old password no longer works after a successful reset.
9. **← Back** on Step 2 returns to the email entry step.

---

## 9. Admin Web Demo Flow

### 9.1 Admin Web Demo — Admin Account

1. Open `http://localhost:5173` (local dev) or `https://smarthome-capstone.duckdns.org` (public production) and log in as `admin@smarthome.local`.
2. **Dashboard:** Security status banner (Low / Elevated / High Risk), KPI cards (Active Devices, Critical Events, Pending Overrides, Latest Telemetry), latest sensor snapshot tiles, risk assessment panel.
3. **Devices:** Table with three seeded devices and status badges. The **Refresh Status** button recalculates statuses from heartbeat timestamps.
4. **Events:** Fire, gas, intrusion, and motion events. Use the severity filter to narrow to `critical` events only.
5. **Access Logs:** NFC access history with four granted entries and one denied. Use the outcome filter; the denial rate card color-codes red when denials are high.
6. **Telemetry:** Featured latest reading panel, sensor tile grid, full historical table.
7. **Overrides:** Override history with status filter. The **Issue Command Override** form is visible. Four **Quick Action** presets populate the form: **Silence Alarm** (`buzzer_off`), **Test Buzzer** (`buzzer_on`), **Stop Pump** (`pump_off`), **Close Valve** (`valve_close`). The action dropdown groups options into *Safe — auto-acked in demo* and *Advanced — requires device confirmation*. Door Unlock is in the Advanced group only and is not a quick action. Submit any safe preset — with `OVERRIDE_DEMO_AUTO_ACK=true` the record becomes `executed` within ~500 ms.

---

### 9.2 Admin Web Demo — Resident RBAC Check

8. Log out via the avatar menu → **Logout**.
9. Log in as `resident@smarthome.local`.
10. Open the **Overrides** page — override history is visible (read-only).
11. The command form is replaced with a locked panel:

    > *"Admin Role Required — Manual override controls are restricted to admin accounts."*

12. All other pages (Dashboard, Devices, Events, Telemetry, Access Logs) remain accessible in read-only mode.

---

### 9.3 Admin Web Demo — Registration and Recovery

**Registration with security question:**

1. Click **Sign Up** on the login page — the Register page opens.
2. Fill in Full Name, Email, Password, Confirm Password.
3. Select a security question from the **Security Question** dropdown — six fixed options.
4. Enter a **Security Answer**. Both the question and answer fields are required; the form blocks submission if either is empty.
5. Leave Admin Key blank for a resident account.
6. Click **Create Account** — the account is created and the dashboard loads.

**Forgot password (account recovery):**

1. From the login page, click **Forgot password?**
2. **Step 1 — Email:** Enter the registered email and click **Find My Question**.
3. The registered security question is displayed below the email field.
4. **Step 2 — Answer:** Enter the security answer and a new password (≥ 8 characters, one uppercase letter, one digit). Click **Reset Password**.
5. On success the page shows the static message: "Password updated. Please sign in."
6. The page does NOT log in automatically and does NOT store a token in `localStorage`. Click **Back to Sign In** and sign in with the new password.
7. The old password no longer works after a successful reset.

---

## 10. Live MQTT Demo

This section demonstrates the full backend MQTT ingestion pipeline using a local Aedes broker and the mock publisher. All five message types are published to the running backend and persisted to MongoDB. Results appear in real time in both the Android app and admin-web without relying on seeded data.

### 10.1 Prerequisites

- `npm install` completed in `backend/`
- Atlas cluster reachable and IP whitelisted — verify first with `npm run test:db`
- `seed:demo-admin` executed so the admin account exists (`admin@smarthome.local`)
- `backend/.env` has valid `MONGODB_URI` and `JWT_SECRET`
- Port `1883` is free on localhost

---

### 10.2 Step-by-step

**Terminal 1 — start local MQTT broker:**

```bash
cd backend
npm run mqtt:broker
```

Expected output:
```
[BROKER] local MQTT broker listening on port 1883
```

Keep this terminal open throughout the demo.

---

**Edit `backend/.env` — enable MQTT:**

```
MQTT_ENABLED=true
```

> If the backend is already running with `MQTT_ENABLED=false`, stop it and restart after this change. The flag is read once at startup.

---

**Terminal 2 — start backend:**

```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

Expected startup output:
```
Backend server running on port 5000
MongoDB connected: ...
MQTT client started.
```

Confirm MQTT is live:

```
GET http://localhost:5000/health
```

Expected: `"mqtt": { "enabled": true, "connected": true }`

---

**Terminal 3 — run mock publisher:**

```bash
cd backend
npm run mqtt:publish:mock
```

Expected output:
```
[PUBLISHER] admin login successful
[PUBLISHER] pending override created: ovr_...
[PUBLISHER] connected to mqtt://localhost:1883
[PUBLISHER] published home/esp32_home_01/heartbeat
[PUBLISHER] published home/esp32_home_01/telemetry
[PUBLISHER] published home/esp32_home_01/event
[PUBLISHER] published home/esp32_home_01/access
[PUBLISHER] published home/esp32_home_01/override/result
[PUBLISHER] disconnected
```

---

### 10.3 What gets written to MongoDB

| MQTT topic | Collection | Operation |
|---|---|---|
| `home/esp32_home_01/heartbeat` | `devices` | Upsert — updates `status`, `last_heartbeat_at`, `wifi_rssi` |
| `home/esp32_home_01/telemetry` | `telemetry_summaries` | Insert — new reading with current timestamp |
| `home/esp32_home_01/event` | `events` | Insert — `fire_detected / critical` with unique run-scoped `event_id` |
| `home/esp32_home_01/access` | `access_logs` | Insert — `granted` NFC entry with unique run-scoped `access_id` |
| `home/esp32_home_01/override/result` | `override_requests` | Update — sets `result: executed` on the override created by the publisher |

Each run generates a unique `event_id` and `access_id` (based on `Date.now()`). The publisher creates a real pending override via `POST /api/overrides` before publishing the result, so the override/result leg always finds a matching record.

---

### 10.4 Verifying results

**Backend Terminal 2** — each accepted message logs:
```
[MQTT] handled home/esp32_home_01/<topic> as <type> for esp32_home_01
```

**Android app:**
- **Dashboard** — Recent Activity updates with the new fire event
- **Alerts tab** — new `fire_detected` entry at the top with the current timestamp and critical color coding
- **Sensors tab** — kitchen row shows fresh readings
- **Overrides screen** — new override record with `status: executed`
- **Devices tab** — `esp32_home_01` shows `online`

**Admin-web:**
- **Events page** — new `fire_detected` row at the top of the table
- **Telemetry page** — new kitchen reading in the All Records table
- **Access Logs page** — new granted NFC entry at the top
- **Overrides page** — new override record with status `executed`
- **Devices page → Refresh Status** — `esp32_home_01` shows `online`

---

### 10.5 Re-running the publisher

Running `npm run mqtt:publish:mock` multiple times during the same demo session is safe. Each run generates new unique IDs and uses current timestamps, so no duplicate key errors occur and each run produces a clearly timestamped new entry in all four collections.

---

### 10.6 Troubleshooting (MQTT-specific)

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `[PUBLISHER] admin login failed` | Backend is not running, or `seed:demo-admin` has not been executed. Run `npm run seed:demo-admin` then restart the backend. |
| `[PUBLISHER] failed to create pending override` | Admin user exists but the backend returned an error. Check Terminal 2 logs for details. |
| `[PUBLISHER] connected` but no `[MQTT] handled` lines in Terminal 2 | `MQTT_ENABLED` is still `false` in `.env`. Stop backend, set `MQTT_ENABLED=true`, restart. |
| `/health` shows `"connected": false` | Broker is not running. Start it in Terminal 1 with `npm run mqtt:broker` before starting the backend. |
| `Error: listen EADDRINUSE :::1883` | Another process holds port 1883. Stop it or set `LOCAL_MQTT_PORT=<other>` for the broker and `MQTT_BROKER_URL=mqtt://localhost:<other>` in `.env`. |

---

## 11. FCM Push Notification Setup

This section covers what must be in place before push notifications work end-to-end. The backend service and Android integration are implemented; what is missing is your project-specific Firebase config that cannot be committed to the repository.

### 11.1 Prerequisites

- A Firebase project with Android app registered (`com.smarthome.security`)
- `google-services.json` downloaded from the Firebase Console
- A Firebase Admin SDK service account JSON key (generated under **Project Settings → Service Accounts → Generate new private key**)

### 11.2 Backend configuration

Place these two lines in `backend/.env`:

```
FCM_ENABLED=true
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_BASE64=<base64-encoded content of your service account JSON>
```

Encode the service account file:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
base64 -i service-account.json | tr -d '\n'

# Windows PowerShell
[Convert]::ToBase64String([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("service-account.json"))
```

Paste the output as the value of `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_BASE64`. Restart the backend.

Verify:

```
GET http://localhost:5000/health
```

Expected: `"fcm": { "enabled": true, "initialized": true }`

**Do not commit the service account JSON file or the base64 string.**

### 11.3 Android configuration

Copy `google-services.json` into `android/app/`:

```
android/app/google-services.json   ← place here, do not commit
```

The file is listed in `.gitignore` and will not be staged. Rebuild the app in Android Studio after placing the file.

**Do not commit google-services.json.**

### 11.4 Verify token registration

1. Log in with either account on the Android app.
2. After login, the app fetches the FCM device token and sends it to `POST /api/users/fcm-token`.
3. Confirm via:

```
GET http://localhost:5000/api/auth/me   (with your JWT)
```

The user document in Atlas will have `fcm_token` set.

### 11.5 Trigger a push notification

With the backend running and `FCM_ENABLED=true`:

```bash
cd backend
npm run mqtt:publish:mock
```

The mock publisher fires a `fire_detected` event. The backend persists it, calls `sendEventNotification`, and dispatches a Firebase push to all users with registered tokens.

Expected notification on device:
- **Title:** `Fire Detected`
- **Body:** `Fire detected in kitchen. Immediate action required.`

---

## 12. EC2 Production Deployment

The backend is deployed to AWS EC2 (Amazon Linux 2023) and managed by PM2 with systemd auto-start.

### 12.1 Verified Deployment State

| Component | Status |
|---|---|
| Backend process | PM2 (`smart-home-backend`), fork mode, `pm2-ec2-user.service` enabled. EC2 backend runtime deployed at `2b11b0f`; later firmware-doc commits exist in origin/main (`ac41d7b` and earlier) but contain no backend runtime changes and were not deployed. Runtime commits deployed: `56fc6c6` (logical device heartbeat validation — device_id regex widened), `60842ac` (component offline notification storm mitigation — OFFLINE_PUSH_CONTROLLER_DEVICE_IDS allowlist), `e46f599` (demo override auto-ack), `30153a1` (safe admin override actions UI), `7ac1230` (security question recovery API). |
| Auto-start | `sudo systemctl enable pm2-ec2-user` — survives reboot |
| Health endpoint | `https://smarthome-capstone.duckdns.org/health` → `status: ok`. HTTP on port 80 redirects to HTTPS (301). |
| MongoDB | Connected to Atlas (`autonomous_smart_home`) |
| MQTT | Connected to local Mosquitto broker on EC2 |
| FCM | Initialized — `FCM_ENABLED=true`, `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_BASE64` set in `.env`. All four critical event types (fire/gas/CO/intrusion) verified end-to-end to physical phone. |
| SMS | Dispatch path verified — Twilio accepted the request (NotificationLog: `channel=sms status=sent`, Twilio Message Log: `Sent`). Handset delivery not yet confirmed (no `Delivered` status in Twilio). SMS initialization confirmed from PM2 startup logs (`[SMS] Twilio client initialized`). |
| Demo Override Auto-Ack | `OVERRIDE_DEMO_AUTO_ACK=true`, `OVERRIDE_DEMO_AUTO_ACK_DELAY_MS=500`. Safe actions (`buzzer_off`, `buzzer_on`, `pump_off`, `valve_close`) auto-complete to `executed` in ~500 ms. Risky actions (`door_unlock`, `pump_on`, `valve_open`, `system_reset`) are not auto-acked. Hazard events remain untouched. See §12.6. |
| Logical device heartbeat support | `56fc6c6` and `60842ac` deployed. Device ID validation regex widened to accept all 14 logical component IDs. Component offline FCM suppressed; only `esp32_home_01` triggers FCM on offline transition. 31/31 local backend tests passed before deploy; EC2 deploy verification ran `check:config` (env/FCM/SMS confirmed) and `test:device-status-monitor` (22/22 cases passed). |
| seed-logical-devices | **NOT run on EC2.** The 14 logical component device records (`pcf8574_01`, `flame_sensor_01`, `pump_rm1_01`, etc.) are not in MongoDB. Run `npm run seed:logical-devices` manually on EC2 before the ESP32 begins publishing component heartbeats. Do not run automatically. |
| Android refresh | `40a4b09` (Events pull-to-refresh + 30 s auto-refresh) and `d383401` (Devices pull-to-refresh + 30 s auto-refresh) committed and built. Physical phone smoke test passed. `77660e5` (Telemetry freshness alignment) also committed. |
| MCH firmware handoff | `firmware/` contains: `FIRMWARE_CONTRACT.md`, `MCH_QUICK_HANDOFF.md`, `ESP32_MQTT_HEARTBEAT_STEP1.md`, `ESP32_MQTT_HEARTBEAT_STEP1_PATCH.md`, `MCH_SAFEHOUSE_TO_SMARTHOME_ADAPTER.md`, `examples/esp32_heartbeat_step1/`. Physical ESP32 MQTT integration not yet tested. |

---

### 12.2 Deploying a New Backend Version

SSH into the EC2 instance and run:

```bash
cd ~/smart-home
git pull
cd backend
npm install --omit=dev
pm2 restart smart-home-backend
```

> **Do not use `pm2 restart --update-env`.**
> That flag replaces PM2's stored environment with the current SSH shell environment, which does not export `.env` vars. The result is that `SMS_ENABLED` and Twilio credentials are absent from the process environment at startup, causing `sendSmsOfflineNotification` to create a `status: sms_disabled` NotificationLog even though `.env` is correct. Plain `pm2 restart` preserves the saved dump environment.

Verify after restart:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:5000/health
pm2 status
```

Expected: `"status": "ok"`, process `online`.

---

### 12.3 Clean Restart (Preferred — After Kernel Updates or First Boot)

A `pm2 kill` + `systemctl restart` cold-start is the most reliable way to ensure all `.env` vars are loaded correctly:

```bash
pm2 save
pm2 kill
sudo systemctl reset-failed pm2-ec2-user
sudo systemctl restart pm2-ec2-user
sleep 5
systemctl status pm2-ec2-user --no-pager
pm2 status
curl -s http://localhost:5000/health
```

Expected startup log sequence (check with `pm2 logs smart-home-backend --lines 30 --nostream`):

```
[FCM] Firebase Admin SDK initialized.
[SMS] Twilio client initialized. Alert recipient configured.
Backend server running on port 5000
MongoDB connected: autonomous_smart_home
MQTT client started.
[MONITOR] device status monitor started (interval: 30s)
```

If `[SMS] Twilio client initialized.` is absent, SMS will not fire. Use the clean restart above — not `pm2 restart --update-env`.

---

### 12.4 Controlled Offline Notification Test

This test verifies the full offline notification pipeline end-to-end: heartbeat → monitor detects `degraded→offline` transition → FCM dispatch + SMS dispatch → NotificationLog entries written to MongoDB.

**Step 1 — Confirm or restore online status:**

If the device is already `online`, skip to Step 2. If `offline`, send a mock heartbeat:

```bash
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@smarthome.local","password":"Admin123!"}' \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['token'])")

TS=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/mock/mqtt \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d "{\"topic\":\"home/esp32_home_01/heartbeat\",\"payload\":{\"device_id\":\"esp32_home_01\",\"status\":\"online\",\"firmware_version\":\"0.1.0\",\"uptime_seconds\":3600,\"wifi_rssi\":-55,\"timestamp\":\"$TS\"}}"
```

Confirm: `GET /api/devices/esp32_home_01` → `"status": "online"`.

**Step 2 — Stop heartbeats and wait.**

The monitor fires every 30 s. Thresholds from the last heartbeat:

| Elapsed | Status |
|---|---|
| 0 – 60 s | `online` |
| 61 – 90 s | `degraded` |
| > 90 s | `offline` |

Poll until `offline` (approx. 90 – 120 s total):

```bash
for i in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8; do
  STATUS=$(curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/devices/esp32_home_01 \
    | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['device']['status'])")
  echo "[poll $i] $(date -u +%H:%M:%SZ) status=$STATUS"
  [ "$STATUS" = "offline" ] && break
  sleep 15
done
```

**Step 3 — Verify NotificationLog entries (wait 8 s after offline confirmed):**

```bash
sleep 8
curl -s "http://localhost:5000/api/notification-logs?device_id=esp32_home_01&limit=6" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

Expected entries for this transition:

| channel | status | error_message |
|---|---|---|
| `fcm` | `sent` | `null` |
| `fcm` | `skipped` | `duplicate_token` (if same FCM token is registered to more than one user) |
| `sms` | `sent` | `null` |

One SMS log per transition. FCM deduplication ensures one send per unique token regardless of how many user records share it.

---

### 12.5 EC2 / SMS Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `[SMS] Twilio client initialized.` missing from startup log | `SMS_ENABLED` is `false` or Twilio credentials are missing in `.env`. Verify with `grep '^SMS_ENABLED=' .env`. Use clean systemd restart (§12.3); never use `pm2 restart --update-env`. |
| SMS NotificationLog shows `status: sms_disabled` | `pm2 restart --update-env` stripped SMS vars from PM2's stored env. Perform a clean systemd restart (§12.3) to fix without changing `.env`. |
| SMS NotificationLog shows `status: failed` with a Twilio region error | Twilio geographic permissions not enabled for the recipient's country. Enable at **Twilio Console → Messaging → Settings → Geo Permissions**, add the country, and save. |
| Twilio Message Log shows `Sent` but phone receives no SMS | 1. Check Message Logs for `Delivered`, `Undelivered`, or an error code — wait a few minutes and refresh, as carrier delivery can lag. 2. Verify the Twilio trial account restriction: if using a trial account, the recipient number must be in the **Verified Caller IDs** list, or upgrade to a paid account. 3. Test with another Turkish number or a different mobile operator (some operators reject Twilio short codes). 4. For reliable demo delivery to Turkey, consider a Turkey-local SMS provider fallback such as **Netgsm** as a drop-in replacement for the Twilio client in `sms.service.js`. |
| `SMS_ENABLED=true` appears twice in `.env` | Harmless — dotenv uses the last occurrence. Remove the duplicate line at your convenience; the system functions correctly with either one. |
| FCM offline notification not received | Confirm `FCM_ENABLED=true`, `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_BASE64` is set, `google-services.json` is in `android/app/` (not committed), and the user's FCM token is registered via `POST /api/users/fcm-token`. |
| PM2 process keeps restarting | Run `pm2 logs smart-home-backend --lines 100` and look for uncaught exceptions. Check Atlas IP whitelist includes the EC2 instance public IP. |

### 12.6 Demo Override Auto-Acknowledgement

`OVERRIDE_DEMO_AUTO_ACK=true` is set in `backend/.env` on EC2. When enabled, the backend auto-simulates ESP32 acknowledgement for a defined set of safe actuator actions after publishing the MQTT command.

**Safe actions (auto-acked in demo — become `executed` in ~500 ms):**
| Action | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `buzzer_off` | Alarm silence / acknowledgement |
| `buzzer_on` | Buzzer test |
| `pump_off` | Stop water pump |
| `valve_close` | Close valve |

**Risky actions (not auto-acked — remain `requested` without real ESP32):**
| Action | Reason |
|---|---|
| `door_unlock` | Physical-security action; requires real device confirmation |
| `pump_on` | Also blocked by gas/CO lockout when a hazard is active |
| `valve_open` | Safety-controlled |
| `system_reset` | System-wide impact |

**Hazard safety:** Auto-acking `buzzer_off` (alarm silence) does **not** resolve the underlying hazard. Active `fire_detected`, `gas_detected`, `co_detected`, or `intrusion_detected` events remain in the `events` collection and are visible in both apps. The PM2 log explicitly records when a hazard is still active:
```
[AUTO_ACK] <override_id>: alarm silenced — SAFETY HAZARD STILL ACTIVE: <event_type> on esp32_home_01. Hazard NOT resolved by this action.
```

**To disable (for production or real-hardware testing):**
```
OVERRIDE_DEMO_AUTO_ACK=false
```
Restart the backend normally — plain `pm2 restart smart-home-backend` (no `--update-env`).

## 13. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Backend exits on start or `/health` returns `database.connected: false` | `MONGODB_URI` in `backend/.env` is missing or contains placeholder text. Verify the Atlas connection string. |
| Atlas connection refused | Your current IP is not in the Atlas Network Access whitelist. Add it at **Atlas → Network Access → Add IP Address**. |
| Android emulator shows "Unable to connect" | Verify the backend is running and reachable at `http://localhost:5000/health` on the host. The default `BASE_URL` (`10.0.2.2:5000`) is correct for the Android emulator. |
| Physical phone shows "Unable to connect" | `BASE_URL` is `https://smarthome-capstone.duckdns.org/` — verify the phone has active internet access. Switch to mobile data if on a restricted Wi-Fi network. |
| Biometric prompt does not appear | The device has no enrolled fingerprint, or there is no stored session. Enroll a fingerprint at **Android Settings → Security → Fingerprint**, then log in once via password. The biometric prompt appears only on subsequent launches with a stored session. |
| Admin Actions card missing on Android | The session is logged in as `resident`. Log out and log back in as `admin@smarthome.local`. |
| Seed scripts fail with a connection error | Run `npm run test:db` from `backend/` first to verify Atlas connectivity before seeding. |
| EC2 backend returns 502 or is unreachable | SSH in and run `pm2 status`. If the process is stopped, run `pm2 start smart-home-backend`. If PM2 is not running, run `sudo systemctl restart pm2-ec2-user`. |
| SMS notification not firing on EC2 | See Section 12.5 for the full SMS troubleshooting table. Most commonly caused by `pm2 restart --update-env` or Twilio geo permissions not enabled. |

## 14. Capstone Requirement Coverage

This section maps each objective from the capstone proposal (§1.3, §7.2) to the current state of the software repository. Items are marked honestly — the evaluation panel should treat partial items and known gaps as-is rather than as claimed complete.

---

### §1.3 Project Objectives

| Objective | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Multi-room prototype (kitchen, living room, bedrooms, garage) with sensors and actuators | **Backlog — MCH scope** | Physical model is not in this repo. Room IDs (`kitchen`, `living_room`, `bedroom_1`, `bedroom_2`, `garage`, `hallway`) are defined in the contract and used in seeded data. |
| Detect fire, gas, vibration/intrusion, NFC access events | **Partially done** | Backend pipeline handles all event types with correct severity routing. Seeded data demonstrates the full flow. Real hardware sensor triggers require ESP32 firmware — integration docs prepared in `firmware/`; physical testing is MCH scope. |
| NFC door access control — record all access attempts | **Partially done** | Access log data model, REST API, admin-web Access Logs page, and Android Alerts tab are all complete. Seeded records include granted and denied entries. Live RC522 hardware integration is MCH/firmware scope. |
| Complete software system — user registration, RBAC, dashboards, audit logging | **Done** | JWT auth, admin/resident RBAC, all 7 admin-web pages, all Android screens (Login, Dashboard, Devices, Alerts, Sensors, Overrides, Profile), both roles fully working. |
| Real-time alerting ≤ 5–10 s + heartbeat offline detection | **Partially done** | Heartbeat offline detection is fully implemented (0–60 s: online, 61–90 s: degraded, > 90 s: offline). FCM push notifications are implemented and wired; end-to-end delivery time requires live hardware and a configured Firebase project. |
| Automatic + manual safety responses — authorized override path | **Partially done** | Manual override is fully implemented with RBAC (admin only), gas/CO pump lockout enforced, and override history logged. Safe admin override actions (`buzzer_off`, `buzzer_on`, `pump_off`, `valve_close`) exposed on both Android and admin-web; demo auto-ack enabled on EC2 (`OVERRIDE_DEMO_AUTO_ACK=true`) — verified end-to-end on physical phone and browser. Automatic fire suppression (pump + valve activation) requires firmware. |

---

### §7.2 Success Criteria

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Events transmitted, processed, stored, and displayed end-to-end | **Done** (via seeded data path) | All event types stored in MongoDB, surfaced via REST API, displayed in both apps. Live MQTT path is implemented but `MQTT_ENABLED=false` by default; no live broker is configured. |
| Heartbeat timeout → device marked offline → logged | **Done** | Backend calculates device status from `last_heartbeat_at`. `POST /api/devices/refresh-status` forces recalculation. All three status states demonstrated by seeded devices. |
| Critical events → push notification to mobile | **Implemented** | FCM is fully wired: backend dispatches on `fire_detected`, `gas_detected`, `co_detected`, `intrusion_detected`; Android receives and shows notifications. Requires `google-services.json` (not committed) and `FCM_ENABLED=true` with a service account in `.env`. See Section 11. |
| Connectivity loss → SMS notification | **Backend/provider verified; handset delivery unconfirmed** | SMS offline notification implemented via Twilio (`sms.service.js`). Backend SMS path and Twilio provider acceptance verified on EC2 — `NotificationLog` confirms Twilio accepted the SMS request (`channel=sms status=sent`) and Twilio Message Log shows `Sent`. Handset delivery not yet confirmed (Twilio has not shown `Delivered` and the SMS did not arrive on the phone). Requires `SMS_ENABLED=true` and Twilio credentials in `.env`. See §12.4 for the controlled test and §12.5 for troubleshooting. |
| Authentication and authorization prevent unauthorized actions | **Done** | JWT required on all write endpoints. RBAC enforced: resident blocked from POST `/api/overrides` (403) and `POST /api/devices/refresh-status` (401). Client-provided roles are never trusted. |
| Mobile app and admin panel show clear, readable status and logs | **Done** | Both apps show device status badges, event severity, access log outcomes, override status, and telemetry readings with clear labels. |

---

### Technology Stack Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js + Express backend | **Done** | Running on port 5000. All REST endpoints implemented. |
| MongoDB Atlas | **Done** | Mongoose models for all collections. Seed scripts provided. |
| JWT + RBAC authentication | **Done** | Login, `/api/auth/me`, RBAC middleware on admin-only routes. Password recovery via security question (`POST /api/auth/recovery/question`, `POST /api/auth/recovery/reset`) — answer bcrypt-hashed, no JWT issued on reset, old password invalidated. Registration security question dropdown and two-step forgot-password flow implemented on both admin-web and Android. |
| MQTT event ingestion (backend) | **Implemented; unverified live** | `MQTT_ENABLED=false` by default. Backend MQTT router and ingestion logic are present. Live end-to-end requires a running broker and ESP32 firmware. |
| Kotlin Android (Jetpack Compose, MVVM) | **Done** | All screens implemented. Repository pattern. Observable state via ViewModel. |
| Biometric unlock (Android) | **Done — stored-session only** | Convenience unlock using stored JWT. Not a standalone biometric authentication flow. |
| React admin web | **Done** | All 7 pages implemented. Light/dark theme. RBAC gating on Overrides page. |
| Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) | **Implemented and verified** | Firebase BoM + messaging-ktx in Android. Backend FCM Admin SDK initialized from `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_BASE64`. Token registration endpoint `POST /api/users/fcm-token`. Push triggered on all critical event types and on device offline transitions. FCM token deduplication active — shared tokens produce one `sent` + one `skipped/duplicate_token` NotificationLog entry. Requires `google-services.json` placed locally (not committed). |
| SMS offline notifications | **Implemented; provider dispatch verified** | Twilio SMS via `sms.service.js`. Fires on `degraded→offline` transition. `NotificationLog` entry written for every dispatch (including `sms_disabled` and `failed` states). Provider error messages sanitized — E.164 phone numbers masked before storage. Backend path and Twilio acceptance verified on EC2 (NotificationLog: `channel=sms status=sent`, Twilio Message Log: `Sent`). Handset delivery not yet confirmed. |
| AWS EC2 deployment | **Deployed with HTTPS** | Backend running on EC2 (Amazon Linux 2023) behind Nginx 1.30.1 with TLS termination. PM2 (`smart-home-backend`) managed by systemd (`pm2-ec2-user.service`, enabled on boot). MongoDB Atlas connected, MQTT connected, FCM and SMS both initialized. Public endpoint: `https://smarthome-capstone.duckdns.org` (Let's Encrypt cert, auto-renewed via cronie). Port 5000 closed externally. See §12 for deploy/restart procedures and §15 for full HTTPS deployment details. |
| ESP32 firmware | **Integration docs prepared; physical testing not yet done** | `firmware/` contains full MCH integration contract (`FIRMWARE_CONTRACT.md`), quick handoff (`MCH_QUICK_HANDOFF.md`), step-by-step heartbeat guide (`ESP32_MQTT_HEARTBEAT_STEP1.md`), patch guide for code-final (`ESP32_MQTT_HEARTBEAT_STEP1_PATCH.md`), SafeHouse→SmartHome adapter guide (`MCH_SAFEHOUSE_TO_SMARTHOME_ADAPTER.md`), and a standalone heartbeat test sketch (`examples/esp32_heartbeat_step1/`). Physical ESP32 firmware flashing and MQTT integration not yet verified — MCH team scope. |

## 15. Public HTTPS Deployment

The backend and admin-web are publicly accessible over HTTPS at `https://smarthome-capstone.duckdns.org`. Port 5000 is closed externally; MQTT port 1883 remains open for future ESP32 connectivity.

### 15.1 Architecture

```
Browser / Android app
       │  HTTPS (443)
       ▼
  Nginx 1.30.1  (EC2, Amazon Linux 2023)
  ├─ GET /        → /var/www/admin-web  (React SPA, built with VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://smarthome-capstone.duckdns.org)
  ├─ /api/*       → proxy_pass http://localhost:5000
  └─ /health      → proxy_pass http://localhost:5000/health
       │  HTTP localhost only
       ▼
  Express backend (port 5000, internal only)
       │
       ▼
  MongoDB Atlas
```

HTTP on port 80 → 301 redirect to HTTPS. HSTS enforced (`max-age=63072000`).

### 15.2 DNS and TLS

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Domain | `smarthome-capstone.duckdns.org` |
| DNS provider | DuckDNS (free subdomain) |
| Points to | EC2 public IP `18.184.39.188` |
| TLS certificate | Let's Encrypt (certbot 4.2.0, nginx plugin, HTTP-01 challenge) |
| Certificate path | `/etc/letsencrypt/live/smarthome-capstone.duckdns.org/` |
| Expiry | 2026-09-04 |
| Auto-renewal | cronie — `/etc/cron.d/certbot-renew`: `0 0,12 * * * root /opt/certbot/bin/certbot renew --quiet --nginx` |
| Renewal dry-run | `All simulated renewals succeeded` |

### 15.3 AWS Security Group State

| Port | Protocol | Source | Status | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 22 | TCP | Restricted IP | Open | SSH access |
| 80 | TCP | 0.0.0.0/0 | Open | HTTP → HTTPS redirect |
| 443 | TCP | 0.0.0.0/0 | Open | HTTPS (Nginx TLS termination) |
| 1883 | TCP | 0.0.0.0/0 | Open | MQTT — intentionally open for future ESP32 |
| 5000 | TCP | — | **Closed** | Backend hardened to localhost-only via Nginx |

> **MQTT 1883 note:** Port 1883 is open intentionally. The ESP32 firmware publishes MQTT messages directly to this broker port. Do not close it unless the MQTT broker is being retired.

### 15.4 Android HTTPS Migration

Committed in `5b1cdbf` (`chore(android): use HTTPS API endpoint`):

| Change | File |
|---|---|
| `BASE_URL` → `"https://smarthome-capstone.duckdns.org/"` | `android/app/build.gradle.kts:18` |
| `cleartextTrafficPermitted="false"` | `android/app/src/main/res/xml/network_security_config.xml` |

Physical phone test passed after migration: admin login, all screens (Dashboard, Devices, Alerts, Sensors, Overrides), safe override execution (`buzzer_off` → `executed` in ~500 ms with auto-ack), resident login and RBAC (Admin Actions card absent).

### 15.5 Verified HTTPS Endpoints

Verified from external network (local Windows) and from within EC2 (`curl localhost`):

| Request | Result |
|---|---|
| `GET https://smarthome-capstone.duckdns.org/` | 200 — admin-web React SPA |
| `GET https://smarthome-capstone.duckdns.org/health` | 200 — `{"status":"ok","database":{"connected":true}}` |
| `GET https://smarthome-capstone.duckdns.org/api/events` | 200 — event array |
| `GET http://smarthome-capstone.duckdns.org/` | 301 redirect → HTTPS |
| `GET http://18.184.39.188:5000/` | Connection refused (port closed externally) |
| `GET http://localhost:5000/health` (from EC2) | 200 — internal only |
